/*Problem
A sorting algorithm A is said to have more time complexity than a sorting algorithm B if it uses more number of comparisons for sorting the same array than
algorithm B.
Given that algorithm A uses X comparisons to sort an array and algorithm B uses Y comparisons to sort the same array, find whether algorithm A has more time 
complexity.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y — the number of comparisons used by algorithms A and B to sort the array respectively.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the algorithm A has more time complexity than B and NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).*/
